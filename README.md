# Jigsaw

## Description

Jigsaw is a block-based, visual programming language designed to help beginners learn 
the fundamentals of programming, and hone their programmatic thinking in a fun and 
interactive way.

Users can create simple scripts through the code editor by arranging and connecting 
blocks together, run their scripts at the press of a button and see the results in 
the console.


### Background

Jigsaw is heavily inspired by the [Scratch programming language](https://scratch.mit.edu/).
